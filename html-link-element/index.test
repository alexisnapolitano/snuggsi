// Preload Processing steps
// - https://w3c.github.io/preload/#x3-1-processing
/*
The appropriate times to obtain the resource are:

  - When the user agent that supports [RFC5988] creates a Document and processes Link headers that contain a preload link.
  -
  - When the preload link's link element is inserted into a document.
  -
  - When the preload link is created on a link element that is already in a document tree.
  -
  - When the href attribute of the link element of a preload link that is already in a document tree is changed.
  -
  - When the crossorigin attribute of the link element of a preload link that is already in a document tree is set, changed, or removed.
  -
  - When the as attribute of the link element of a preload link that is already in a document tree is set or changed to a value that does not or no longer matches the request destination of the previous obtained external resource, if any.
  -
  - When the as attribute of the link element of a preload link that is already in a document tree but was previously not obtained due to the as attribute specifying an unsupported request destination is set, removed, or changed.
  -
  - When the type attribute of the link element of a preload link that is already in a document tree but was previously not obtained due to the type attribute not specifying a parsable MIME type or specifying an unsupported MIME type for the request destination is set, removed, or changed.
  -
  - When the media attribute of the link element of a preload link that is already in a document tree but was not previously obtained due the media attribute's value being not a valid media query list or one that does not match the environment is set, removed, or changed.
